    <p> Dear Mr. Oliver,
        <br>

        I hope you had a lovely weekend!

        I am writing to request aprons for our team.
        <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        While working on our project, we've encountered situations where grease and other residues have affected our uniform.
        <br>
    </p>
    <div>
        Aprons would greatly help in keeping our clothes clean and maintaining a professional appearance during our work, especially that the stains are hardly removable.
        <br>
    </div>
    <p>
        Your assistance in providing aprons for our team would be much appreciated.
        <br>
    </p>
    <div>
        May I also suggest our Marketing team would work on looking for sponsors for our Greenpower Aprons and Uniform, please?
    </div>
    <p>
        Thank you for your kind consideration.
        <br>
